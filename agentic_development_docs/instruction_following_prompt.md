I have given some instructions in @agentic_development_docs/project_design_plan/0_constella_design_plan.md to update the same file @agentic_development_docs/project_design_plan/0_constella_design_plan.md

the instructions are enclosed in tags like [INSTRUCTION] My instructions... [/INSTRUCTION]
Please follow those instructions and update @agentic_development_docs/project_design_plan/0_constella_design_plan.md

Don't make any other changes not asked in [INSTRUCTION] [/INSTRUCTION]

Once you have implemented one instruction under [INSTRUCTION] Particular instruction [/INSTRUCTION] , then remove that Instruction tag and its internal instruction content from the file.
