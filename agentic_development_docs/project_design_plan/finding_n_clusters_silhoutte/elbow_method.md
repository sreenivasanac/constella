Elbow method
Recall that, the basic idea behind partitioning methods, such as k-means clustering, is to define clusters such that the total intra-cluster variation [or total within-cluster sum of square (WSS)] is minimized. The total WSS measures the compactness of the clustering and we want it to be as small as possible.

The Elbow method looks at the total WSS as a function of the number of clusters: One should choose a number of clusters so that adding another cluster doesnâ€™t improve much better the total WSS.

The optimal number of clusters can be defined as follow:

Compute clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means clustering) for different values of k. For instance, by varying k from 1 to 10 clusters.
For each k, calculate the total within-cluster sum of square (wss).
Plot the curve of wss according to the number of clusters k.
The location of a bend (knee) in the plot is generally considered as an indicator of the appropriate number of clusters.
