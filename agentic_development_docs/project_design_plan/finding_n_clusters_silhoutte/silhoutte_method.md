Average silhouette method
The average silhouette approach weâ€™ll be described comprehensively in the chapter cluster validation statistics. Briefly, it measures the quality of a clustering. That is, it determines how well each object lies within its cluster. A high average silhouette width indicates a good clustering.

Average silhouette method computes the average silhouette of observations for different values of k. The optimal number of clusters k is the one that maximize the average silhouette over a range of possible values for k (Kaufman and Rousseeuw 1990).

The algorithm is similar to the elbow method and can be computed as follow:

Compute clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means clustering) for different values of k. For instance, by varying k from 1 to 10 clusters.
For each k, calculate the average silhouette of observations (avg.sil).
Plot the curve of avg.sil according to the number of clusters k.
The location of the maximum is considered as the appropriate number of clusters.
