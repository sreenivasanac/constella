## Development implementation
  - When writing non-obvious functions or code blocks, include a concise explanation (either a docstring or an inline comment) so the intent remains clear.
  - As far as possible, keep the development code simple and straight-forward.
  - You are an expert software engineer with 30 years of programming experience. Follow best programming practices.
  - If there are TODOs, add as comment in the same code file while you are implementing them.
  - Keep the code simple as much as possible. avoid handling extra cases that are far away from the expectation instruction. If handling those extra cases are very necessary and important, then you can handle them.

## Development communication
  - If you have any question about the implementation, which is an important one, then you can stop and ask me before continuing the implementation.
  - For any useful non-intuitive communication or logging during coding implementation, write documents to `agentic_development_docs/agent_communication_docs`. These communication are Not mandatory - so don't write just for the sake of it, but for development purposes.
    - Examples include: assumptions made during implementation in the file @agentic_development_docs/agent_communication_docs/assumptions_made_by_agent.md
    - Any different Design decision apart from given in instruction in @agentic_development_docs/agent_communication_docs/design_decision.md
    - Future work remaining like TODOs (that was given in the instruction for this version), you can update in agentic_development_docs/agent_communication_docs/future_work.md
    - For any other questions that you come across, write them in @agentic_development_docs/agent_communication_docs/questions.md
  - Feel free to create new markdown files when you want to log your progress, implementation or if you think it will be useful for continuing the implementation of the project.
- If you have made implementation changes, update them back to the relavant project design plan files above.
- If you think there are more useful rules you can add to this coding_rules.md or general_rules.md file while you are implementing, then feel free to append those rules to these files.
